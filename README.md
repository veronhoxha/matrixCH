# matrixCH

- The task:

Implement the chessboard matrix type which contains integers. In these matrices, 
every second entry is zero. The entries that can be nonzero are located like the same-colored squares on a chessboard, with indices (1, 1), (1, 3), (1, 5), ..., (2, 2), (2, 4), .... 
The zero entries are on the indices (1, 2), (1, 4), ..., (2, 1), (2, 3), ... Store only the 
entries that can be nonzero in row-major order in a sequence. Don't store the zero 
entries. Implement as methods: getting the entry located at index (i, j), adding and 
multiplying two matrices, and printing the matrix (in a shape of m by n).

- NOTES 
1. The task is designed to work only for even by even matrixes (2x2, 2x4, 4x4, 4x6, ...).
2. The task is a school homework.
